# Final-Project
The final project for 3110.

GitHub Instructions:
  Before starting work, make sure that you are on the [Dev] branch!!!
 
    [git checkout Dev]
    
  To make sure that you are on the Dev branch, type this command and see if Dev is highlighted:
  
    [git branch]

  Before starting work, pull the latest code using:
 
    [git pull origin Dev]
    
  This pulls data from the [Dev] branch to the [origin] in your computer
  
  Then add the file youve changed:
 
    [git add file]
  
  After you've worked on your code, make sure that no one else has worked on the same files that you have, to avoid merge
  conflicts. I will sort these out if they occur. Text immediately if merge conflicts occur.
  
  After finishing work:

    [git commit -m "Commited by <NAME>, did <THINGS>"]
    
  This makes a commit on your computer. NOTHING IS PUSHED YET. To push to Dev:
 
    [git push -u origin Dev]
