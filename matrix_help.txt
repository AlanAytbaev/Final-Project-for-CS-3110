Matrix Functions:

- Creation

Matrices can be defined in two ways: 
1. Defining the rows first then the matrix of those rows 

let one = [1 2]
let two = [3 4]
let m = matrix one two

2. Defining the matrix as a list of rows

let m = matrix [1 2] [3 4]

These both represent the same matrix.
Both ways require the "matrix" keyword

- Addition ("madd")
- Subtraction ("msub")
- Multiplication ("mdot")

These functions all take in 2 matrices as the arguments. For addition and 
subtraction, the matrices must be of the same size. For multiplication the 
matrices must follow the dimensions M x N, N x R where M could equal R, but 
doesn't have to

- Row Echelon Form Reduction ("echelon")
- Reduced Row Echelon Form Reduction ("rref")

These functions both take in one matrix as an argument and return the echelon 
form or the reduced row echelon form of that matrix
