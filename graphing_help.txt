Graphing Help:

In order to graph a function, you need to define it according to the function 
definition rule: (let <function name> = fun ( <argument list> ) -> <function body>).
ex.
let f = fun (x) -> x*x

Then in order to graph the function, type in 
"graph <function name> <lower bound> <upper bound>"
ex. 
graph f -10 10
