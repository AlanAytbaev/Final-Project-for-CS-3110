The Modular Calculator
==============================
By Emily, Nathan, Alan, and Saranya


Installation Instructions:

	If you have not done so already, unzip the zip file which contains this file using the appropriate tool.

	Enter the directory containing these unzipped files.

	Open a CLI session in this directory.

	Run the command [make build] to create the build files.

	If you do not already have it, this part of our project requires you to install gnuplot to enable the graphing functionalities. 

	Important: if there exists file main.byte, remove it using [rm main.byte] before operating.

Operating Instructions:
	
	Install the calculator using the installation instructions above before running.

	Run [make calc] to execute the calculator.

Calculator Operations: 

        1) Arithmetic Operations Examples: a + b | a subt b | a * b | a / b | a % b 

	2) Function Definition : let funname = fun ( x y ) -> x + y

	3) Let Definition : let x = e where e is an expression 

	4) Trigonometric functions : sin x | cos x | tan x | cot x | csc x | sec x where x is the angle in degrees only

	5) Statistics functions : mean [lst] | median [lst] | max [lst] | min [lst] | 		stdev [lst] where [lst] is a list of numbers

	permutations: perm n r | combinations: comb n r where n<r

	6) Graphing : First define single variable function ; for instance let func = 	fun (x) -> x*x

	Then type graph func . This should produce a .png which has the graph of the 		function in the working directory of the project. 

Help:
	Read this file again, but slowly.
